<h1 class="small">One thing about me is that I'm glad you're here.</h1>

My name is spelled Alisa, but pronounced like <i>Alyssa</i>, because it serves as my name in both English and Japanese. This combo strikes the best balance between hitting similar syllabic inflections but retaining the phonetic transcription of Japanese written text. My parents were pragmatists, you see.

Iâ€™m an eager learner, inclusive communicator, and always self-reflective with a high bar for myself and others. Design is what I was born to do, full stop. I am especially interested in systems design and the gnarly problems that come with it, and deeply moved by how one small change can cause a landslide in another. (This fascination extends to other interests in life, such as linguistics and the nuance that is necessarily lost in translation all because our ancestors split off from one another thousands of years ago. [Babel](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57945316) is a book written with this premise in mind.)

The role of metaphor in digital experiences also occupies my brainspace often. Design is a practice in building consistent and coherent metaphors, many of which [precede any design decision](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) we make today. The pixels we draw are metaphors abstracted from the written code so that anyone can interact with it, regardless of technical knowledge. Idk, I just think that's super cool, even though we take it for granted nowadays.

Before design, I studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Washington. My academic background helped me get comfortable with experimenting wildly within rigid constraints to solve problems that seem simple on the surface, but get more complex the more you dig in. My love for this kind of work has only grown with my design practice.

Lastly, I leave you with some stuff I've done recently:

- Participated on the UW Philosophy Department alumni career panel for winter 2024 (I also got to do it in 2020!)
- Led a design workshop with highschoolers through [Young Women Empowered](https://youngwomenempowered.org/)
- Serve as a mentor through UW's Huskies@Work program
