<h3 id="the-product">The product</h3>

<p>Reading Progress is an an app for Teams EDU that helps students practice reading independently. Students record themselves reading, and educators track student performance with the support of AI. It was released publicly on 8/24/21.</p>

<p>This project focuses on my contributions to the flow where <strong>educators create a Reading Progress assignment</strong> and distribute it to students.</p>

<h3 id="the-team">The team</h3>

<p>I was the lead designer for creating a Reading Progress assignment. I worked with 3 engineers, 1 PM, and 1 content designer over the course of 10 months.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>When I joined the Reading Progress crew, the team had wrapped up heavy concept testing and had many handwavy designs to match. These designs ‚Äî while they communicated the basic features outlined in the spec ‚Äî were neither human-centric nor research-informed. <strong>My role was to take these concept designs and make them ship-ready.</strong></p>

<p>Moreover, there were some tensions with how these designs fit into Teams EDU from both technical <em>and</em> UX perspectives, as Teams EDU did not yet have a robust framework for creating assignments with apps. Part of my work on this project involved partnering with these teams to develop a new framework in advocacy of a better app assignment experience.</p>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<h3 id="user-insights">User insights</h3>

<p>Early research had taught my team that educators are adaptable, but busy ‚Äî they are willing to try new apps, but are quick to abandon if they don‚Äôt see the value right away. This meant the more barriers we remove in creation, the faster they can get to the real value of the app where students actually do the reading.</p>

<div class="design-principle">üí° design principle: get educators through creation as fast as possible</div>

<p>To this end, I made it a top priority to understand how educators are <em>already</em> doing things so we could meet them where they were. With no dedicated researcher on our team, I kicked off my own research to learn more about where educators were sourcing readings, organizing materials, etc. I found that <strong>while core scenarios remained consistent, specific needs differed drastically across educators.</strong></p>

<h3 id="ecosystem-insights">Ecosystem insights</h3>

<p>Lastly, as I learned about how educators assign readings, I uncovered user jobs that I took back to my team to get crisp on how Reading Progress fits into the Microsoft app ecosystem. Which user jobs should Reading Progress address <em>specifically</em>, and which are already addressed by other apps? Is this also in line with educator expectations? Which teams do we need to collaborate</p>

<p>I shared these findings with our partner team to ensure alignment.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>With each iteration, I kept coming back to how we might üí° get educators through creation quickly. My wireframes got progressively simpler as I reframed insights, reprioritized user jobs, and brainstormed with my team.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.russorizio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ef3-placeholder-image.jpg" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>

<p>Another way we handled this was introducing a sample content library so educators had something to experiment with. I worked with my manager Paul to advocate for this scenario.</p>

<p>In the end, I landed on a design whose hierarchy asks for only the bare minimum decision-making. This stows away some of the options that offer a richer experience while keeping them contextually relevant and accessible as users get more comfortable, which üí° extends to many.</p>

<h3 id="fit-and-finish">Fit and finish</h3>

<p>To ensure that Reading Progress carries the credibility of a first-party Teams EDU app, I paid close attention to the look and feel of our UI, including working with the Teams EDU expression team for custom illustrations.

<p>When it comes to accessibility, I believe that experiences should never be ‚Äúmerely usable‚Äù. Accessibility is always top of mind in my entire design processes, and this project was no different. Here‚Äôs an example of how I carried that through to final hand-off to engineers.</p>
