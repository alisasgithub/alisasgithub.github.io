# Hi! I'm Alisa. I design at Microsoft. Most recently, I developed design strategy for artificial intelligence in education experiences.

Human-centered design has my heart, though content design is a close second. I love having a problem to solve -- big, messy, systems-level ones are my favorite kind.
